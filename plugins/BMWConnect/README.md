# Homematic-Virtual-Interface  - BMW Connect

This plugin fetches the battery level of your electical BMW and reports this to the CCU as a filling sensor.

You have to setup your connected drive credentials at the plugin settings.
The plugin creates a separate filling sensor for each of your vehicles (if you own more than one ;o)
